            <h3>Donald J. Trump is the 45th President of the United States. He believes the United States has incredible
                potential and will go on to exceed even its remarkable achievements of the past. His campaign slogan for
                President was, “Make America Great Again,” and that is exactly what he is doing.</h3>
            <ul id="info">
                <li>
                    Donald J. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the
                    standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and
                    entertainment. Mr. Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and
                    public service. He remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, Mr. Trump followed in his
                    father’s footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark New York City. There,
                    the Trump name soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and,
                    subsequently, throughout the world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mr. Trump is also an accomplished author. He has written more than fourteen bestsellers. His first
                    book, The Art of the Deal, is considered a business classic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for the Presidency on June 16, 2015. He then accepted the
                    Republican nomination for President of the United States in July of 2016, having defeated seventeen
                    other contenders during the Republican primaries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On November 8, 2016, Mr. Trump was elected President in the largest Electoral College landslide for
                    a Republican in 28 years. Mr. Trump won more than 2,600 counties nationwide, the most since
                    President Ronald Reagan in 1984. And he received the votes of more than 62 million Americans, the
                    most ever for a Republican candidate. These voters, in delivering a truly national victory and
                    historic moment, rallied behind Mr. Trump’s commitment to rebuilding our country and disrupting the
                    political status quo that had failed to deliver results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mr. Trump won, in part, because he campaigned in places Republicans have had difficulty
                    winning—Flint, Michigan, charter schools in inner-city Cleveland, and Hispanic churches in Florida.
                    He went there because he wanted to bring his message of economic empowerment to all Americans.
                    Millions of new Republicans trusted Mr. Trump with their vote because of his commitment to
                    delivering prosperity through a reformed tax code, an improved regulatory environment, and better
                    trade deals. President Trump’s victory has brought Americans of all backgrounds together, and he is
                    committed to delivering results for the Nation every day he serves in office.
                </li>
                <li>
                    President Trump has been married to his wife, Melania, for twelve years, and they are parents to
                    their son, Barron. Mr. Trump also has four adult children, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany, as
                    well as ten grandchildren.
